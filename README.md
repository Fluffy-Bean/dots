# Config Files

Fluffy's config files for Arch Linux!!!!!!!!!

## Credits

I did not make the Paradise nor Gruvbox theme, credit goes to creators!

- [Paradise](https://github.com/Manas140/paradise)
- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)

I also did not make some of the scripts, and as such cannot include them in the config (unless modified to my needs)

- [original rofi power menu bash code](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/blob/master/simple/grayblocks/scripts/powermenu.sh)
- [Insparation for pacman update polyar script](https://github.com/Manas140/dotfiles/blob/main/config/polybar/updates.sh)
- [Polybar spotify module](https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify)

I took great insperation from Manas' dotfiles, though most of the code was made by me, I still want to credit them for their amazing work
